Once you have cloned this repository on your computer, you can use the following commands:

`ddev start` This command starts the local development environment.

`ddev stop` This command stops the local development environment.

To develop in the application, you can use the `ddev ssh` command. This opens a terminal session in the virtual development environment. Here you can run the `composer install` command to install the dependencies and use other symfony commands.

When everything is correctly set up, you will see this homepage at the URL that appears in your terminal after you have used `ddev start`.
